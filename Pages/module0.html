    We'll be using GitHub (link at top left) to organise our files. It lets you save different versions of a project as you go along, 
	    and keeps shared work organised when working on group projects.
    It's also where you'll be accessing and submitting coding assignments, but we'll get to coding later.

<!-- Code of Ethics	  
  <div class="w3-container" id="M0" style="margin-top:35px">    
    <h1 class="w3-xlarge w3-text-blue"><b>Code of Ethics Case Studies</b></h1>
    <p style="font-weight:initial">  
    Consider Principles 1.1 and 1.2 of the Programming Code of Ethics and present a real life current or historical example of when 
	    one or both of the principles were upheld or violated.<br><br> 
      <b>1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.</b>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics" style="margin-top:15px; font-weight:initial">
This principle, which concerns the quality of life of all people, affirms an obligation of computing professionals, both individually and collectively, to use their skills for the benefit of society, its members, and the environment surrounding them. This obligation includes promoting fundamental human rights and protecting each individual's right to autonomy. An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing, including threats to health, safety, personal security, and privacy. When the interests of multiple groups conflict, the needs of those less advantaged should be given increased attention and priority.
Computing professionals should consider whether the results of their efforts will respect diversity, will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs, and will be broadly accessible. They are encouraged to actively contribute to society by engaging in pro bono or volunteer work that benefits the public good.
In addition to a safe social environment, human well-being requires a safe natural environment. Therefore, computing professionals should promote environmental sustainability both locally and globally.	  	  
      </blockquote>
      <b>1.2 Avoid harm</b>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics" style="margin-top:15px; font-weight:initial">
In this document, "harm" means negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust. Examples of harm include unjustified physical or mental injury, unjustified destruction or disclosure of information, and unjustified damage to property, reputation, and the environment. This list is not exhaustive.
Well-intended actions, including those that accomplish assigned duties, may lead to harm. When that harm is unintended, those responsible are obliged to undo or mitigate the harm as much as possible. Avoiding harm begins with careful consideration of potential impacts on all those affected by decisions. When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified. In either case, ensure that all harm is minimized.
To minimize the possibility of indirectly or unintentionally harming others, computing professionals should follow generally accepted best practices unless there is a compelling ethical reason to do otherwise. Additionally, the consequences of data aggregation and emergent properties of systems should be carefully analyzed. Those involved with pervasive or infrastructure systems should also consider Principle 3.7.
A computing professional has an additional obligation to report any signs of system risks that might result in harm. If leaders do not act to curtail or mitigate such risks, it may be necessary to "blow the whistle" to reduce potential harm. However, capricious or misguided reporting of risks can itself be harmful. Before reporting risks, a computing professional should carefully assess relevant aspects of the situation.
